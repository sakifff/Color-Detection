# Color-Detection
Color detection project using python

This project uses a dataset of colors and Python OpenCV's real time computer vision tools to identify the color in a specific part of an image just by double clicking on different areas of the image.

Required packages include:
- numpy
- pandas
- OpenCV
- argparse

To run the application, open up the command line in the directory of the program and type in "python colors.py -i <path of your image>". Then make sure to double click on different parts of the image to return the name of the color.

So for example if the images are in the same directory as the python script and you are using one of the example images above, you would write "python colors.py -i pic1.jpg" in the command line
